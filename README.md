# Welcome Page

Welcome to my welcome page! This page showcases my skills in HTML, inline and external CSS styling, Mailchimp integration, flexbox, and Bootstrap. 

I have deployed this web page using Netlify, and you can access it directly by clicking on the following link: [welcome-page-artbyhanieh.netlify.app](https://welcome-page-artbyhanieh.netlify.app/).

The main page serves as a welcome page, providing an introduction and guiding you to explore my art page. On the art page, I have displayed some of my own paintings, allowing you to view my artistic creations. Additionally, there is a contact page where you can get in touch with me if you have any inquiries or are interested in my artwork.

Feel free to navigate through the various sections of the page to discover more about my artwork. If you have any questions or would like to connect, don't hesitate to reach out to me. Enjoy your visit to my welcome page!
